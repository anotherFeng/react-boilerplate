# Boiler Plate
boilerplate for react so you can start a new react project without worrying about most of the setups.

## Getting Started
Makesure to have npm, live-server, and babel-cli installed first.

``
npm install   //install all dependencies
``


``
npm start   //start node server
``


``
npm run react   //compile as you make changes to react
``

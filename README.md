# Boiler Plate
boilerplate for react so you can start a new react project without worrying about most of the setups.

## Getting Started
Makesure to have npm, live-server, and babel-cli installed first.

``
npm run build   //install all dependencies
npm run build   //compile once
npm run watch   //compile as you make changes

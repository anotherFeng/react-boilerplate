# Boiler Plate
This boilerplate includes minimum but essential configuration to start a react application with node/express.

## Getting Started
If you want to use this without node and express, simply delete everything under server folder and all its dependencies.

``
npm install   //install all dependencies
``

``
npm run react-dev  //compile as you make changes to react
``

``
npm run start //run node server
``

You may also run webpack in production mode to uglify/minify your dist files.
``
npm run react-build //compile files in minified version using production mode   
``
